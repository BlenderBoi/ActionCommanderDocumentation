Action Bin Panel
*****************

The Action Bin shows all the Actions in your Blend File. You can think of this as a Global Action Bin, where all the Action created / imported are available in your Blender File is listed. 

With this, you can find out the "Orphan Action" which are actions that are not assigned to any objects, or to inspect the actions that are not currently in use, but want to keep in the blend file for later.
