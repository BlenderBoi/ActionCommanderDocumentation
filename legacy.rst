Frame Ranger vs Action Commander
--------------------------------

Action Commander will be the successor of Frame Ranger in future. Their core feature are more or less the same for now, however, there is a few things to note between them

Right Now, Frame Ranger has more feature because it is a "Bundle of Multiple Addons", being a quite bloated addon and unfocused and becoming more and more **difficult to maintain**. 

Action Commander however, is focused solely on Action Management, you can think of it like "Frame Ranger with only Object Action Manager". 

Why Action Commander?
----------------------------

By Focusing only on Action Management, which is the core feature of Frame Ranger, it will make Maintaining the addon much more manageable, it will also make the addon less bloated.
